        Today, one of the essential functions of technology is the
        collection, storage, processing, and transmission of data.
        The healthcare industry, including mental health services, are
        huge benefactors of these advances in technology.  From birth,
        medical facilities start collecting information about all
        individuals; they do so even up to the point of death and all
        points in between.  Over a lifetime,that is an abundance of
        information about an individual.  The question that must be
        answered is, how is that data protected to ensure patients''
        privacy rights?  The more information collected on
        individuals, the more responsibility is assumed by those who
        collect data; methods for how the data is collected, used and
        shared must ensure the protection of patients'' privacy
        rights.  This challenge is one that needs to be navigated and
        addressed by medical professionals and facilities,
        policymakers, and the individuals whose data is collected.
        Specifically in the mental health field, by resolving
        patients'' privacy concerns, policymakers and researchers can
        transform the field by introducing more cost effective
        strategies, ensuring patients'' sense of security, and
        establishing new and more appropriate norms to communicate
        sensitive health information.

        In spite of the large influx of data that exists in many
        fields, scientists have faced with many challenges when it
        comes to the topic of data sharing.  Opponents of this
        practice are skeptical to data sharing due to privacy concern,
        fear of stigmatization, the problem of funding, repository of
        data, transparency, and so forth. While it is important to
        keep these challenges in mind, it is critical to take a look
        at the different advantages of data sharing.

        The importance of data sharing and the replication of the
        sciences, but what about data archiving?
    abstract: >
        This project will showcase the importance to encourage data
        sharing among scientists to advance the sciences. Data sharing
        presents many advantages, such as it reduces costs, it allows
        researchers to build up on the work of previous researchers, it
        helps to respond to societal problems quicker, etc. While it is
        critical to encourage and value the collaborative spirit among
        fellow scientists, another conversation that needs to happen is
        data archiving.  Where to house the data? and who pay to keep
        the data?  It is necessary that both public and private sectors
        get together in an attempt to solve the problems surrounding
        data archiving.
