        Today, one of the essential functions of technology is the collection,
        storage, processing, and transmission of data.  The healthcare industry, including
        mental health services, are huge benefactors of these advances in technology.  From
        birth, medical facilities start collecting information about all individuals;
        they do so even up to the point of death and all points in between.  Over
        a lifetime,that is an abundance of information about an individual.  The question
        that must be answered is, how is that data protected to ensure patients''
        privacy rights?  The more information collected on individuals, the more responsibility
        is assumed by those who collect data; methods for how the data is collected,
        used and shared must ensure the protection of patients'' privacy rights.  This
        challenge is one that needs to be navigated and addressed by medical professionals
        and facilities, policymakers, and the individuals whose data is collected.
        Specifically in the mental health field, by resolving patients'' privacy concerns,
        policymakers and researchers can transform the field by introducing more cost
        effective strategies, ensuring patients'' sense of security, and establishing
        new and more appropriate norms to communicate sensitive health information.

        In spite of the large influx of data that exists in many fields, 
        scientists have faced with many challenges when it comes to the topic of data sharing. 
        Opponents of this practice are skeptical to data sharing due to privacy concern, 
        fear of stigmatization, the problem of funding, repository of data, transparency, and so forth.
        While it is important to keep these challenges in mind, 
        it is critical to take a look at the different advantages of data sharing.
