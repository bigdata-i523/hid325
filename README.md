   title: Impact of Big Data on the Privacy of Mental Health Patients
   abstract: >
       Society has experienced a lot of benefits with the introduction of technology. Today, one of the essential functions of        technology is the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of data. The healthcare industry, including mental        health services, are huge benefactors of these advances in technology. From birth, medical facilities start collecting        information about all individuals; they do so even up to the point of death and all points in between. Over a                  lifetime,that is an abundance of information about an individual. The question that must be answered is, ''How is that        data protected to ensure patients' privacy rights?'' The more information collected on individuals, the more                  responsibility is assumed by those who collect data; methods for how the data is collected, used and shared must ensure        the protection of patients' privacy rights. This challenge is one that needs to be navigated and addressed by medical          professionals and facilities, policymakers, and the individuals whose data is collected. Specifically in the mental            health field, by resolving patients' privacy concerns, policymakers and researchers can transform the field by                introducing more cost effective strategies, ensuring patients' sense of security, and establishing new and more                appropriate norms to communicate sensitive health information.
